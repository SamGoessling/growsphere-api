# Serialization
In Java, objects that are commonly serialized include those that need to be persisted, transmitted, or shared between different components of a system. Here are some examples:

1. **Session Objects**: In web applications, user session data is serialized to maintain state between requests.
2. **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: These are used to transfer data across different layers or tiers of an application, often serialized for remote communication.
3. **JavaBeans**: These are reusable software components that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool and are often serialized for persistence.
4. **Persistence Objects**: Objects that represent rows in a database can be serialized for caching or saving their state.
5. **Messages**: In messaging systems, objects are serialized to be sent over the network as messages.

Serialization is used because it allows for a straightforward way to convert complex objects with multiple fields and hierarchies into a linear, platform-independent stream of bytes. This stream can then be easily stored, transmitted, and reconstructed back into the original object on a different machine or at a different time¹²³⁴.
